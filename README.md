The DriverPass project was created to design a cloud based web system that helps users prepare for their DMV driving tests. This system
offers online courses, practice tests, and driving lesson scheduling. The client, DriverPass, wanted a secure, scalable, and user friendly
platform accessible to both desktop and mobile devices, with distinct roles for students, drivers, and administrators. The system needed 
to manage user accounts, lesson scheduling, and payment processing while integrating with DMV systems for real time policy updates. One 
area done particularly well was defining clear functional and nonfunctional requirements, especially around system security, scalability, 
and cloud infrastructure. These details ensured reliable performance and data protection for all users.

If I were to revise one aspect on the system created, I would improve the user interface design by adding wireframes to better visualize 
navigation and layout. This would help identify usability issues early and ensure the platform is intuitive for all users. The project 
effectively interpreted user needs by incorporating role based access, scheduling limits, and DMV integration demonstrating the importance
of aligning technical design with real world use. In future projects, I would continue using structured design methods like UML modeling 
and requirement analysis while adopting Agile practices, user feedback loops, and automated testing to refine and optimize the system 
throughout development.
